📊 Day 2 – COVID-19 Global Data Analysis Dashboard
🔹 Project Overview

This project is part of my 100 Days – 100 Datasets Challenge, where I analyze one real-world dataset daily to build strong data analytics and storytelling skills.

In Day 2, I worked with a global COVID-19 dataset to understand:

How the pandemic spread across countries

Which regions were most affected

How recovery, active cases, and deaths compare globally

How trends evolved over time

The goal was to practice the end-to-end data analytics pipeline:
Data Cleaning → EDA → Visualization → Insight Storytelling

🔹 Dataset

Source: Public COVID-19 dataset
Main Columns Used:

Date

Country/Region

Confirmed

Deaths

Recovered

Active

🔹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checked for missing and inconsistent values

Standardized date formats

Aggregated data at the country and global level

Verified numeric columns for correct data types

Removed unnecessary columns for dashboard performance

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key questions explored:

Which countries had the highest confirmed cases?

How do active vs recovered cases compare globally?

How does the fatality rate vary across countries?

Is the global trend flattening or still increasing?

🔹 Dashboard (Power BI)

The dashboard includes:

🌍 Global KPIs: Total Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active

📈 Time-series trend of confirmed cases

🏆 Top 10 countries by confirmed cases

⚠️ Fatality rate comparison by country

🔎 Filters by country and date

🔹 Key Insights

COVID-19 cases are heavily concentrated in a few countries

The US, Brazil, and India contribute a major share of global cases

Recovery counts are high, but active cases remain large

Fatality rates vary widely by country, indicating differences in healthcare capacity and reporting

The global trend shows continuous growth during the analyzed period (no clear plateau)

🔹 Business / Policy Interpretation

High-impact countries should be prioritized for resource allocation

Regions with high fatality rates may need healthcare system strengthening

Trend analysis can help in early surge detection and planning interventions

🔹 Tools & Tech Stack

Python – Data cleaning & EDA

Pandas, NumPy – Data processing

Power BI – Dashboard & visualization

Git & GitHub – Version control & project tracking
